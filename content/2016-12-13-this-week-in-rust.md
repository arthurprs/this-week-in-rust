## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Allow `Self` to appear in the where clause of trait impls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1647).
* [Safe intrinsics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1248). Allow intrinsics to be marked as _safe_, overriding the implicit `unsafe` from being in an extern block.
* [Procedural macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1566).

## New RFCs

* [Warn by default when encountering a statement which only consists of an equality comparison](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1812).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [Conventions for Cargo.toml files](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/41).
* [Customising Rustfmt (FCP)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/33).

Ready for PR:

* [boolean and arithmetic expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/18).
* [struct and union declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/30).
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/32).
* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/34).

Other notable issues:

* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
